Yipee for generated ascii text...  

This is an ascii / ansi editor thingie in the style of 64Pixels. 
Instead of a game however, it is an editor that you can use to draw ascii art.
Some of its code is unclean, but I'll fix it later.

To run it, you need Pygame for Python 3: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame
And Python 3. Python 2 won't work for this job (I do 2 // 2 division, and file opening with encodings)

So there you go. Have fun! (Or not!)
